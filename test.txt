Artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving, by processing data and adapting over time. AI benefits include automation of repetitive tasks, improved accuracy, and enhanced decision-making across various fields like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. Common examples include virtual assistants, chatbots, and systems used for fraud detection and medical image analysis. 
Key concepts and benefits
How it works: Instead of relying solely on explicit instructions, AI systems learn from large amounts of data to find patterns and make predictions.
Core technologies: Major branches of AI include machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP).
Benefits: AI can automate workflows, making businesses more efficient and productive. It can also provide deeper insights from complex data, leading to more informed decisions.
Everyday examples: You interact with AI through services like search engines, digital assistants (like Siri or Alexa), and personalized recommendations on streaming services. 
Types of AI
Narrow AI: Also known as weak AI, this type is designed to perform a single, specific task, such as a virtual assistant or a chess-playing program.
Generative AI: This AI can create new content like text, images, or code in response to a user's prompt.
General AI: This is the hypothetical type of AI that could perform any intellectual task that a human can. 
Applications
Customer service: AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants handle customer inquiries with human-like conversation.
Healthcare: AI is used for tasks like analyzing medical images to detect diseases and for developing new drugs.
Autonomous vehicles: AI enables self-driving cars to navigate, perceive their surroundings, and make decisions.
Cybersecurity: AI systems continuously monitor and analyze network traffic to detect and prevent threats.
